# Library Management System (DSA Based)

This project is a **C++ Library Management System** that applies **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
It manages books using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for efficient insertion, searching, deletion, and traversal.

## 🚀 Features
- Insert a new book with ISBN, title, and author
- Search for a book using ISBN
- Delete a book from the system
- Display all books in **In-Order** (sorted by ISBN)
- Display all books in **Level-Order Traversal** (using Queue)
- Count total number of books
- Find the **oldest (smallest ISBN)** and **newest (largest ISBN)** book

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:** Binary Search Tree (BST), Queue, Traversals
